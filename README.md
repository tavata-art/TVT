## ‚ú® Features

Tavata CMS is not just a simple blog. It's a powerful platform designed with a professional feature set:

*   **Dual Content Types:**
    *   **Static Pages:** For "evergreen" content like "About Us" or "Terms and Conditions".
    *   **Blog Posts:** A complete, time-based blogging engine.
*   **Rich Content Editing:** Powered by **django-summernote**, providing a beautiful WYSIWYG editing experience.
*   **Dynamic, Configurable Widgets:**
    *   Build and place widgets (Recent Posts, Most Viewed, Categories, etc.) in different "zones" (e.g., sidebars) directly from the admin panel.
    *   Widget behavior (like item count) is configurable.
*   **Full Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   Supports English, Spanish, and Catalan out-of-the-box.
    *   Translates everything: database content (using `django-modeltranslation`), interface text (`.po` files), and URLs.
*   **User & Profile Management:**
    *   Complete user authentication flow (Login, Logout, Signup).
    *   Extended user profiles with custom avatars and biographical information.
*   **Interactive Comment System:**
    *   Nested (threaded) comments with reply functionality, powered by `django-mptt`.
    *   Admin-configurable comment moderation (auto-approve or manual).
*   **Advanced Navigation:**
    *   Fully database-driven menu system. Administrators can build and reorder multiple menus (e.g., main navigation, footer links, social links) via the admin.
*   **Global Site Configuration:**
    *   A central settings panel (using `django-solo`) to manage site-wide parameters like pagination, caching timeouts, and branding without touching the code.
*   **Performance-Oriented:**
    *   A configurable caching system for widgets and menus to reduce database load.
    *   Pagination implemented on all content lists.
*   **SEO Ready:** All content types include fields for custom Meta Titles and Meta Descriptions.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Philosophy

This project was built with a few key principles in mind:
*   **Modularity:** Each distinct piece of functionality (blog, pages, widgets) is encapsulated in its own Django app.
*   **Configuration over Code:** Empowering the site administrator to control as much as possible (menus, widgets, settings) from the admin panel without needing developer intervention.
*   **Cleanliness and Best Practices:** Adhering to Django's design philosophies, internationalization standards, and professional development workflows (e.g., using Git branches for features).
